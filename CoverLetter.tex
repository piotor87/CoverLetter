I am extremely delighted at the idea of applying to the position of Data Scientist in your company. It was about 8 years 
ago when I first heard, as a Physics undergraduate student, about the possibility of analyzing statistically 
large data sets of human interactions as a way to increase our knowledge on human behavior and therefore allowing 
to contribute to the development of technologies that can help individuals in their daily tasks. Ever since I've grown 
more and more passionate about the field, continuing my academic studies with a Master Degree in Physics of Complex Systems in Turin and  
a PhD in the analysis of scientometric data at Aalto University. During my PhD studies I have been mainly
focused on the statistical analysis of large data sets
with a particular interest in data stemming from scientific publications.


Although I found my experience in Academia to be rewarding, I've decided to move away from the Academic sector in order to work with "real life" data and scenarios. 
Working at your company would be an exciting way for me to combine the pleasure in analying large data sets, while contributing the development of practical solutions.
